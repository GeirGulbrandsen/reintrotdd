* As a cashier, I need a wau to enter the price of a product by hand, so that I can sell a product to a customer even when the Point of Sale Terminal doesn't find a price for that product.
* As a store manager, I cant to be reminded that a product's price was not  found, so that /i can fix the price list to avoid this happening again.

##Performance
* WHat happens when we scan 2000 products to sell to a single customer?
